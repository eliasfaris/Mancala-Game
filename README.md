# Description
The game begins with a menu section for users to pick the boardgame theme and the number of marbles within each pit. Once the "Play" button is clicked on the menu, the menu closes and the gameboard is visible with the corresponding input from the menu. Finally, the game is played with two people, one being player A and the other being player B. Each player has 5 redo's per turn after a move was made during that turn.

# Learning Outcoming
This project enhanced my object-oriented design skills in java using two design patterns, observer pattern(MVC) and strategy pattern. My GUI programming was strengthened in order for the users to have a better experience playing the game. Java Swing was used for GUI programming.
