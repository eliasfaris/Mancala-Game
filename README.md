# Description
The game begins with a menu section for users to pick the boardgame theme and the number of marbles within each pit. The game is played with two people, one being player A and the other being player B. Each player has 5 redo's per turn after a move was made during that turn.

# Learning Outcoming
This project enhanced my object-oriented design skills in java using two design patterns, observer pattern(MVC) and strategy pattern. My GUI programming was strengthened in order for the users to have a better experience playing the game. Java Swing was used for GUI programming.
